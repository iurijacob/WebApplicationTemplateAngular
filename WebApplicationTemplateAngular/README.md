* .Net Core2.2 / Angular 7 / Clarity Design Template

This is a solution template meant to be used in fast start of .Net Core Angular based apps. 
It uses Clarity Design framework to style pages.

This template is still in deep development, so it's just barely functional.

Many thanks to (Jason Watmore)[https://github.com/cornflourblue] for providing the excellent 
(angular-6-registration-login-example)[https://github.com/cornflourblue/angular-6-registration-login-example], 
which code I have fully updated and adapted to this template.

The main features (not fully available by the time of this document) are:

- Fresh VS2017 Project;
- Net Core 2.2;
- Angular 7;
- Clarity Design;
- EntityFramework Core;
- SignalR;
- Pages and Modules;
  - A home landing page;
  - User login to restricted area;
  - User registration;
  - User Profile module;
  - Users Management module;
  - Page to show online users in real time (to illustrate SignalR superpowers)

A better documentation will be provided soon. See Ya!
